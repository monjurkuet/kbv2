# Textual Hierarchy & Theory

## Parallel Channels/Rectangles

> **Definition: Parallel Channel** - A price pattern formed by at least 4 touches (2 on the bottom, 2 on top) where price moves between parallel trendlines.

> **Definition: Rectangle** - A specific type of parallel channel where the trendlines are horizontal (sideways channel).

> **Definition: Measured Move** - The vertical distance of the channel height, which is projected from the breakout point to determine price targets.

> **Pro Tip:** "There should be at least 4 touches, 2 on the bottom 2 on top. Technically the pattern should be viewed as neutral as price can break up or down, but trading the break in the overall trend direction yields better results."

> **Pro Tip:** "Look for an increase in volume upon the breakout."

> **Pro Tip:** "Never ever delete a channel from your chart when broken because the old channel will be broken and come back as a new channel. The old channel acts as a support."

> **Pro Tip:** "Daniel likes to draw his channels from the respected bottom candle closes to the respected top candle closes but if there is an important factor such as S/R flip, he goes for a wick as well. There is no hard rules, see what is respected more."

## Day Trading Channels

> **Pro Tip:** "I will generally trade a channel from bottom to top, or top to bottom with a take profit set at the mid point of the channel. I like to take 50% profit at the mid point and move stops up to breakeven. I will compound the trade if there is a close above the midpoint."

## Early Signs a Range Could Form

> **Pro Tip:** "You can get early signs a range may form. If you have a move from a major support to a major resistance, and the price starts to close back under the resistance line then it appears the resistance is holding, and you could short back down to the bottom of the range support, which in turn will start to create a channel."

## Price Formed a Well Defined Channel

> **Pro Tip:** "Deviations from the range. Price gets outside of the range, but instead of getting follow through, gets series of Lower highs and Lower Lows to get back inside of the range. Once back inside the range after a deviation one would enter a trade to the side of the channel, taking profit in the middle."

# Mathematical & Tabular Data

## Channel Height Measurement Formula

The measured move is calculated as:

$$\text{Channel Height} = \text{Top Channel Boundary} - \text{Bottom Channel Boundary}$$

## Fibonacci Channel Extension Levels

| Level | Value |
|-------|-------|
| 0     | 0.000 |
| 0.236 | 0.236 |
| 0.382 | 0.382 |
| 0.5   | 0.500 |
| 0.618 | 0.618 |
| 0.66  | 0.660 |
| 0.786 | 0.786 |
| 1     | 1.000 |
| 1.618 | 1.618 |
| 2     | 2.000 |
| 2.618 | 2.618 |

## Price Target Calculations

For breakout trades:
- TP1 = Opposite channel boundary
- TP2 = Breakout point ± Channel Height
- TP3 = Breakout point ± (2 × Channel Height)

For channel trading:
- Partial Profit = Channel Midpoint
- Full Profit = Opposite channel boundary
