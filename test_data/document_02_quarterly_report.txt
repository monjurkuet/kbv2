3. Timeline: Project is 9 months behind schedule

According to the audit report, Project Nova was officially moved to "Failed" status on May 15, 2023, by decision of CEO Elena Vance.

However, a confidential memo dated June 10, 2023, from Dr. Vance to the Board of Directors indicates that the project may be revived with a new technical approach and additional funding of $4 million.

The memo states: "While Project Nova has encountered significant challenges, the underlying technology remains valuable. I recommend a strategic pivot rather than complete abandonment."
